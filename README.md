# ðŸ“Š Sales Prediction - Data Science & Analytics

## ðŸ“Š Project Overview

This project aims to build a machine learning model that predicts sales for a company based on historical sales data. By analyzing features like advertising spend, product pricing, and previous sales, the model forecasts future sales performance. This beginner-friendly project demonstrates data analysis, preprocessing, feature engineering, and building a predictive model for sales.

## Project Overview

This Sales Prediction project demonstrates the following:
- Data analysis and visualization
- Data cleaning and preprocessing
- Feature engineering and selection
- Building and evaluating a regression model for sales prediction

## Dataset

The Sales dataset contains information about individual sales transactions, including:
- `SalesId`: Unique ID for each transaction
- `Sales`: Sales amount (target variable)
- `AdvertisingSpend`: Amount spent on advertising
- `ProductPrice`: Price of the product
- `Discount`: Discount applied to the product
- `StoreLocation`: Location of the store where the sale occurred
- `SalesPerson`: Salesperson involved in the transaction
- `Date`: Date of the sale
- `Region`: Geographical region where the sale took place

## Project Steps

1. **Data Loading and Exploration**: Load and inspect the dataset to understand its structure, identify missing values, and assess data quality.
2. **Data Cleaning**: Handle missing values, especially for `Sales`, `AdvertisingSpend`, and `ProductPrice`. Clean and format the data for analysis.
3. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**: Analyze the relationship between different features and sales using visualization techniques such as histograms, scatter plots, and correlation matrices.
4. **Feature Engineering**: (Optional) Engineer new features, such as `SalesPerEmployee` or `SalesPerRegion`, to capture additional insights.
5. **Data Preprocessing**: Encode categorical features and scale numerical data as required for the model.
6. **Model Training**: Build a regression model using algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to predict the `Sales` outcome.
7. **Evaluation**: Evaluate the modelâ€™s performance using metrics such as Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared. Analyze the modelâ€™s feature importance to understand influential factors.
8. **Conclusion**: Summarize the findings and insights gained from the analysis and model predictions.

## Results

The model achieves a certain level of accuracy in predicting sales, with key influential features identified, such as:
- Advertising spend
- Product pricing
- Region
- Discount applied

## Requirements

To run this project, you will need:
- Python 3.x
- Jupyter Notebook
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`, `scikit-learn`

## Usage

To view or execute the code:
1. Clone this repository to your local machine.
2. Open the Jupyter Notebook and run each cell sequentially.

## Conclusion

This project showcases the steps involved in building a regression model for sales prediction with a focus on data analysis and feature engineering. Through this analysis, we gain insights into the factors that affect sales performance.
