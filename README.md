# üìä Sales Prediction - Data Science & Analytics

## üìä Project Overview

Welcome to the **Sales Prediction** project! Based on historical sales data, this project aims at predicting sales performance of a company. Using the machine learning algorithm, we aim to project future trends in order to drive business optimization with the support of the decision-makers. All of that will be done using features like advertising spend, product pricing, and previous sales data for a detailed formation of the predictive model.

## üéØ Objectives

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleaning the data by handling missing values, outliers, and scaling numerical features.
- **Feature Engineering**: Creating new features based on existing data to improve model performance.
- **Model Building**: Using machine learning algorithms like Linear Regression, Random Forest, or XGBoost to predict sales.
- **Evaluation**: Evaluating model performance using metrics like Mean Absolute Error (MAE), Mean Squared Error (MSE), and R-squared.
- **Prediction**: Generating predictions on future sales based on the trained model.

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools & Libraries Used

- **Python**: The primary programming language for data manipulation and analysis.
- **Pandas**: Used for data cleaning, preprocessing, and analysis.
- **Scikit-learn**: Provides machine learning algorithms and tools for model training and evaluation.
- **Matplotlib & Seaborn**: Used for visualizing data and model results.
- **XGBoost**: An efficient library for boosting algorithms (optional depending on the model used).

## üåü Key Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the dataset for accurate predictions.
- **Feature Engineering**: Derives new features to enhance model performance.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms for sales prediction.
- **Evaluation Metrics**: Uses standard evaluation metrics such as MAE, MSE, and R-squared to assess the model.
- **Visualization**: Displays key insights, including trends in sales data and model performance.

## üìà Visualizations

Here are some key visualizations you'll find in this project:

1. **Sales vs. Advertising Spend**: A scatter plot showing the relationship between advertising spend and sales.
2. **Prediction vs. Actual Sales**: A line plot comparing predicted sales versus actual sales.
3. **Sales Distribution**: A histogram illustrating the distribution of sales data.
4. **Feature Importance**: A bar chart showing the importance of various features in the prediction model.
