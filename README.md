# 🛒 Sales Prediction Project

## 📄 Project Overview
Welcome to the **Sales Forecasting** project! The project focuses on the prediction of the sales of a company using historical sales data. Using machine learning algorithms, we will predict and forecast future sales performance to realize main trends and optimize business decisions for decision-making. The dataset contains such features as advertising spend, product pricing, and previous data sales, which will help in constructing the predictive model.


## 🔍 Project Highlights
Data Preprocessing: Handled missing values, encoded categorical features, and scaled numerical data.
Model Training: Applied different regression models and selected the best-performing one.
Performance Evaluation: Used evaluation metrics to assess the model's predictive power.
Feature Engineering: Improved the model with new features to enhance prediction accuracy.

## 📊 Evaluation Metrics
The trained model was evaluated using the following metrics:

Mean Squared Error (MSE): 2.6625
R-squared (R²): 0.9138
Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE): 1.6317
Mean Absolute Error (MAE): 1.3110
These metrics indicate that the model has strong predictive capabilities, with an R-squared value of 0.91, showing that approximately 91% of the variance in the sales data is explained by the model.

## 📈 Visualization and Key Features
Visualizations
Correlation Heatmap: Displays correlations between features to identify significant relationships.
Feature Importance Plot: Highlights which features contribute most to the model's performance.
Distribution Plots: Analyze the spread and skewness of key variables.
Actual vs. Predicted Sales Plot: Visual comparison of true sales values versus model predictions.
Key Features
Data Insights: Identified impactful factors affecting sales, including trends over time and seasonality.
Feature Importance Analysis: Highlighted influential predictors such as marketing_spend, store_location, and product_price.
Model Interpretation: Explained the variance and residuals to understand prediction accuracy.

## 🔬 Project Steps
Data Collection: Loaded the dataset and examined its structure.
Data Preprocessing: Cleaned the data, handled missing values, and encoded categorical variables.
Feature Engineering: Created and selected features to improve model performance.
Model Training: Used regression models like Linear Regression, Decision Tree Regressor, and XGBoost Regressor.
Evaluation and Optimization: Evaluated the model using MSE, RMSE, MAE, and R² metrics to choose the best model.

## 📈 Results
The model demonstrated an R-squared value of 0.9138, indicating that it can effectively predict sales. The error metrics (MSE, RMSE, and MAE) are reasonably low, showcasing the model's efficiency.

## 📦 Future Enhancements
Hyperparameter Tuning: Further optimize the model's performance.
Incorporate More Features: Include additional variables that might impact sales.
Use More Advanced Models: Explore deep learning approaches for even better accuracy.
