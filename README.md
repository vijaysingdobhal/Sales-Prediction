## Project Description

The objective of this project will be to design a prediction model of sales of the product, and the machine will use the advertising expenditure data. This project consists of several steps, that are as follows:

1. **Problem Definition**: Prediction of sales in the near future based on advertising expenditure across different platforms: TV, Radio, and Newspaper.
2. **Data Collection & Preparation**: Collect required datasets and pre-clean the data by removing missing values and outliers and proceed with preprocessing the data.
3. EDA / Data Visualization: Understand distributions, associations, and trends in the data using plots
4. Model Development : Use machine learning algorithms to predict sales based on the advertising spend, such as **Linear Regression**, and **Random Forest Regressor**.
5. Model Validations: Metrics : Mean Absolute Error, Mean Squared Error, RÂ² Score
6. Hyperparameter Tuning: Fine tune the model's accuracy based on fine-tuning the hyperparameters.

This model will assist businesses in anticipating the sales over subsequent periods, thereby intelligently allocating their advertising budget.

## Dataset

The dataset of this project has been utilized with the below columns:

- **TV**: Advertising Expenditure on TV - (Continuous variable).
- **Radio**: Advertising Expenditure on Radio - (Continuous variable).
- **Newspaper**: Advertising Expenditure on Newspaper - (Continuous variable).
- **Sales**: Target variable - (Continuous), sales of products.
